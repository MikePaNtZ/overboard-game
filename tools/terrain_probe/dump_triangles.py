# dump_triangles.py -- UE editor python (run via -run=pythonscript, see README below).
#
# Extracts every triangle of every static-mesh surface (StaticMeshComponent AND
# InstancedStaticMeshComponent / HierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent) that overlaps a
# probe region of OB_City, transformed to WORLD space, and writes them to a flat binary file
# for rasterize_hfield.py (which runs OUTSIDE the editor) to turn into a MuJoCo hfield.
#
# WHY GEOMETRY EXTRACTION, NOT LINE TRACES: see docs/citypark-level.md -- a commandlet/editor
# world has no physics scene, so every line trace misses. get_section_from_static_mesh is the
# proven method (used for the board-origin measurement in that same doc).
#
# NEVER SAVE ANYTHING. This script only reads the level. Calling save_current_level,
# save_map, save_dirty_packages etc. is how the sublevel got corrupted once before -- see
# docs/citypark-level.md, "never make the sublevel current / never save".

# HARD-SURFACE FILTER -- the single most important parameter in this file.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. The first full dump of OB_City was 12,631,439 triangles and **94% of them
# were foliage**:
#
#     Flora (grass/bushes/trees)   11,871,165   94.0%
#     Ground (dry leaves, sticks)     626,526    5.0%
#     MergeMeshes (the road)           65,142    0.5%
#     Road / ParkSquare / Props       ~68,000    0.5%
#
# One grass asset, SM_grass01_3, is 8,465,926 triangles. The entire road, SM_MergedRoad02, is
# 16,076. rasterize_hfield.py does a top-down MAX-Z raster, so with foliage in the dump it
# rasterises grass blades and leaf litter AS THE GROUND -- the road and its kerbs end up buried
# under vegetation. Three symptoms all trace back to this one cause:
#
#   * 39.041% of posts coming out as holes -- the gaps between foliage clumps. With foliage
#     filtered out that figure is 71.907%, which is the honest measure of how little of this
#     map is hard surface at all;
#   * a cross-section of the road that reads as noise, in which the real kerbs (measured at
#     y = +-4.5 m, ~0.21 m high) are invisible -- locating them at all needed a filter on
#     triangle AREA to see past the grass, and getting that wrong put the ADR-0012 kerb on a
#     building wall (overboard#248).
#
# NOT one of the symptoms: the centre-post datum reading 4.326 mm. That was first blamed on a
# leaf over the spawn point, and it is not -- the value is IDENTICAL with foliage filtered out,
# from a measured (not hole-filled) post. It is simply where the road surface is relative to a
# hand-placed PlayerStart. See DATUM_TOLERANCE_M in rasterize_hfield.py.
#
# A heightmap is a model of the surface you RIDE ON. Grass is not that surface -- a board does
# not ride on top of a blade of grass -- so this is a correctness filter, not an optimisation,
# though it is also a 100x one: ~130k triangles instead of 12.6M.
#
# HOW TO CHANGE IT. Keep is by substring against the mesh's asset path. Prefer adding to KEEP
# over removing from DROP: a surface wrongly kept produces a bump you can see and argue about,
# while a surface wrongly dropped produces a hole that hole-filling silently paves over.
# ============================================================================================
# Only meshes whose asset path contains one of these is extracted. Empty list = keep everything
# (the original behaviour, kept reachable so the filter's effect can be measured rather than
# assumed).
